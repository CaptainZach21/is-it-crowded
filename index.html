<p>This website is to help all of you people who want to eat a dinner out for once, but dont know where to go, and if it's going to be a 2 hour wait. Or mabey you are on your first date and you want to be in a nice quiet resteraunt, and if it's crowded it's bound to be louder than you want. Possibly, you want to go to a bar, and you want it to be full with fans of, for example, the seahawks, so you arent the only one cheering. if you are any of the above this webbsite was made to help you find a short line, or an uncrowded resteraunt, or a rowdy bar.
